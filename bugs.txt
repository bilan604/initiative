main-functionality-test REPO ISSUES:

-Early "notLan32 has not been connected yet" when booting AutoLinkedInEasyApply (minor)


-type=“text” inputs requiring numerical inputs, numerical boolean not triggering in askLLM
-maybe check page after answering questions and see which questions have red err messages?

1. cut to_apply.txt down to 1200 entries, but don't remove the last 50.
2. Stop printing the entire operations list. just the operations[i][“operation”] and id
3. consider -
```
if self.driver.current_url() != "https://www.linkedin.com/feed/":
	wait_input = input("_______________Login Completed?_______________")
```
but this is very extra...
4. Add a button for clearning the to-apply section. (over-the-top)
